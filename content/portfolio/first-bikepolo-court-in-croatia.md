**Client: Bike Polo Zagreb**

* **About the client** 

NGO focused on growing the community and promoting the urban sport of bikepolo in the city of Zagreb and the rest of Croatia, while showing support to the neighboring countries. 

**Project: Crowdfunding campaign**

* **About the project**

After eight years of bikepolo in Croatia, training sessions on empty school yards and parking lots, Bike Polo Zagreb is trying to give something big to the bike community of Zagreb and Croatia. Building a real bikepolo court will truly initiate the growth of a new sport in Croatia. 

What started as a project to build a first bikepolo court in Zagreb, propelled to a more extensive one, this being an urban sports centre. The bikepolo court is sufficient and appropriate enough to be used as a court for street soccer (futsal), in-line hokey, freestyle bmx and skateboarding and streetball (street basketball). Adding a calisthenics "jungle gym", the venue is trully given an urban multi-sport functionality.

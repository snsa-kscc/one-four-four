**Client: approved! Shop**

**About the client** 

Streetwear shops located in Zagreb and Split, Croatia.

**About the project**

A photo shoot for the Tire Calligraphy 2022/23 collection - TC22 Crypto Kids, available in **[approved!](https://approved.style/asortiman/muskarci-brandovi-tire-calligraphy/143)** shop retail locations in Zagreb and online. 

**Creative direction / Concept / Storytelling**

This was the second TC collection being presented and sold in Zagreb's approved! streetwear shop. Once again the idea was to present it through a story - connecting the audience (both Tire Calligraphy and approved customers), which are mostly young people involved in one way or another in the street culture, being it, now again popular skateboarding, music and audio-visual arts.  

As for the first photo shoot / in-store camapign for approved!, again we referenced the 90s US pop culture from the logical sources such as film and music, as an inspiration for the photo shoot, I singled out two, first being the now iconic Kids movie from 1995. and music from the US "rock" band Deftones, also making moves in the early nineties in the aforementioned US skate scene. Both of which influenced my own interests in these communities and the culture around them.      

**Model scouting / Model styling** 

As all Tire Calligraphy collections are neutral-gender, this was the main direction for the styling of the models, them of course being of both gender. The idea was to switch the "roles", more precisely, the styles of the same clothing pieces - the girl wearing them oversized, for a baggy look, which in the 90s was predominatly a male "uniform"; and the guy wearing them as an alternative, true to size.

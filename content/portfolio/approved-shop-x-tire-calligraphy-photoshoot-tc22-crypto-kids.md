**Client: approved! Shop**

**About the client** 

Streetwear shops located in Zagreb and Split, Croatia.

**About the project**

A photo shoot for the Tire Calligraphy 2022/23 collection - TC22 Crypto Kids, available in **[approved!](https://approved.style/asortiman/muskarci-brandovi-tire-calligraphy/143)** shop retail locations in Zagreb and online. 

**Creative direction / Concept / Storytelling**

This was the second TC collection being presented and sold in Zagreb's approved! streetwear shop. Once again the idea was to present it through a story - connecting the audience (both Tire Calligraphy and approved customers), which are mostly young people involved in one way or another in the street culture, being it, now again popular skateboarding, in-line rollerblades, music and audio-visual arts.  

As for the first photo shoot / in-store campaign for approved!, again we referenced the 90s US pop culture from the logical sources such as film and music. As an inspiration for the photo shoot, I singled out a movie which influenced me in more ways, still in my high school years, way back in the 90s. This is what I wanted to "throw - back" at the teens of todays 21st century. This time the influence was the now iconic movie Hackers. As at that period oif time it was talked about "crypto everything" + NFTs, I found it super appropriate to introduce the new crowd to a bit of pop culture from the "early years". 

Of course, this time again, **[a special Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/45x6aikpn8hg9ziczww1q5gku?si=b1c846b98b824752&nd=1)** (with the music from the 90s - my own favourites), was introduced.         

**Model scouting / Model styling** 

As all Tire Calligraphy collections are neutral-gender, this was the main direction for the styling of the models, them of course being of both gender. The idea was to switch the "roles", more precisely, the styles of the same clothing pieces - the girl wearing them oversized, for a baggy look, which in the 90s was predominantly a male "uniform"; and the guy wearing them as an alternative, true to size.

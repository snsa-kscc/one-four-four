**About The House (Tire Calligraphy)**
Established in 2016., we are in the ninth year of Croatian streetwear/fashion brand Tire Calligraphy. The house offers limited editions of Pret-A-Porter aka Ready-to-wear premium, well thought of pieces – they like to call Future Evergreens, “Functional Fashion” and “Not only for show, but for go”.
Each TC piece is cut-n-sew, envisioned and produced in Zagreb, Croatia, with their finest materials sourced from Portugal, Italy and Turkey – they believe in fair pay and support of local cut and sew business.

The Concept**


**A visual, audio and tactile experience – type of event.
Spring symbolizes a change of energies, out with the old – in with the new.**
A pop – up event: a Showcase + Archive sale type of experience.
All pieces will be -40% off.
Business will be conducted as follows: first come, first served principle - WYSIWYG.
TC believes in not repeating itself, so these are the last remaining pieces of their current offerings.


**Spring symbolizes a change of energies, out with the old – in with the new.**
“The dance is rooted in a deep connection with the natural world. Nature is a symbol of a shifting existence, and the transformation and transience of nature and the cycle of the seasons are often incorporated into the “patterns” of butoh dance.”


**Fabric in motion
A visual, audio and tactile experience.**
A once in a lifetime opportunity to experience a butoh-inspired performance executed by a Croatian rooted movement artis from Cyprus, Iva Matosevic.

**Why Butoh?**

• butoh is energetic

• butoh is crude 

• butoh is raw 

• ... like the Denim 

• butoh is expressional 

• butoh is emotional 

• butoh sometimes flows like the light 

• ...like the “white”, that is fragility 

• ...like Cotton, (which is The Source)

**TC pieces explained: A rationale for The Concept
199144**


**With a vision of neutral, universal items in mind, 199144 (premium) items will spread through the seasons not constrained by time, location or fashion trends. These are Future Evergreens. Every item offered is a neutral-gender item.**


Black denim was chosen as key source, signifying the key source that is present in each city, this being concrete and asphalt, dark and sturdy, resisting the elements but also, in a way, accepting them and with that, allowing a visible change which happens over time, years, even decades. Even with all of its lights, the city is a dark place with all the concrete walls and glass of skyscrapers, the streets, the subway lanes.
The raw black denim in all its roughness will start to adapt to each individual, becoming a unique item in fit and color, both being noticeable, but maybe just at the second or third glance.


The TC22 199144 offering was presented as a uniform, a Basic Denim Overall Pant and a Basic Denim Jacket – as a layer of the Hybrid Jacket.
Being neutral in color, fit and minimal in (visible) features, items, each in its own right, are envisioned and created as adaptable to each other and additional garments, thus serving each individual when creating their looks, a uniform of a sort. With a utilitarian approach to wardrobe the items are presented as spacey, oversized if you will, a comfortable wear, both being able to be worn in more than one way.

The white gender-neutral crew was a first piece in our new 199144 collection.
Inspired by Japanese culture and its minimalism and a sense of calm. With an ambition to be as plain and minimal as possible, it still provides much needed details revealed only by the second or third look, such as the  "199144" white embroidered logo on the chest, or the full "Tire Calligraphy" logo in silver on the back, coming fully to life when "attacked" by a force of light, as it is a 3M reflective element.

The black denim pieces juxtaposed with the white on white “maxi-minimal” aesthetics of the single (but one to start it all – 199144) piece, goes perfectly hand in hand with the clean minimal aesthetics of Holographik Space.
In this way juxtaposing the cold and the warmth, that are both visual (cold) and on the other hand tactile (warm), so a full experience indeed, is provided to the audience which will be fully immersed in the offering of both The Space and The Collection through an immersive experience that is a butoh-esque performance
as a pinnacle of the event.

We hoped everyone enjoyed the evening as we have.

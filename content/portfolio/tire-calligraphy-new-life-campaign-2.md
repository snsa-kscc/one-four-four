For Tire Calligraphy TC21 New Life / 199144 - second campaign, we decided to present all of the pieces in a more "wearable" environment, closer to everybody, this being an urban environment, The City - as a direct opposite from the first campaign, a solitude of an island in Winter time. 

Fï»¿ilm was an influence, a "unifomed" look, black, simple, sleek, cold, "heartless", but also, comfortable, universal in "wearability" (neutral gender), and functional likewise - we channeled the infamous Tetragrammaton Clerics - a special elite force of soldiers, tought in the highest arts and knowledge of martial arts. 

Of course, the movie is Equilibrium.

The backdrops of the locations used in the shoot reflected the simple "colors" - this being black, or one "off-color", this being gray. 

In addition to two "brutalist minimal" locations used, the third and the final one - almost symbolic,  as the holly trinity itslef, talking about Clerics - was the Croatian Bishops' Conference aka Conferentia Episcoporum Croatiae, as a reference for minimal, cold and simplistic solitude. 

For additional inspiration and in depth understanding of our concept, check **[a special Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/45x6aikpn8hg9ziczww1q5gku?si=b1c846b98b824752&nd=1)** we created for this occasion. 

**Project coordination / Location scouting / Model scouting / Model styling** 

As all Tire Calligraphy collections are neutral-gender, this was the main direction for the styling of the models, them of course being of both gender.

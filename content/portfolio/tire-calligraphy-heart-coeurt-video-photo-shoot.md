For Tire Calligraphy TC23/4 Heart Coeurt offering, the idea was simple, to introduce the inspiration for the color choices of the latest Concept / Offering, for the cotton and print likewise. 

Nature with "Her" ever-changing temper, this of course being The Seasons, was a major influence this time around, and what would be more appropriate than a photo (+video) shoot out on the trails, in the woods and on the rock.   

Speaking of **"rock"** we have created a new short film with a special soundtrack from a Croatian **"stoner"** rock group Rochelle, Rochelle. Even the name of the audio is fitting - we didn't want to change it - **Erocktika.**

And - back at it again, yes, of course, **[a special Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/45x6aikpn8hg9ziczww1q5gku?si=b1c846b98b824752&nd=1)** was introduced, with the contemporary music from genres such as post rock - obviously, and post metal - to illuminate the vasteness of the Nature which was an amazingly great influence.

  

**Concept / Project coordination / Model scouting / Model styling** 

As all Tire Calligraphy collections are neutral-gender, this was the main direction for the styling of the models, them of course being of both gender.

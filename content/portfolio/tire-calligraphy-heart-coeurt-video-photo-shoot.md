For Tire Calligraphy TC23/4 Heart Coeurt offering, the idea was simple, to introduce the inspiration for the color choices of the latest Concept / Offering, for the cotton and print likewise. 

Nature with "her" ever-changing temper, this of course being The Seasons, was a major influence this time around, and what would be more appropriate then a photo (+video) shoot out on the trails, in the woods and on the rock.   

Speaking of "rock" 



Of course, this time again, **[a special Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/45x6aikpn8hg9ziczww1q5gku?si=b1c846b98b824752&nd=1)** (with the music from the 90s - my own favourites), was introduced.         

**Concept / Project coordination / Model scouting / Model styling** 

As all Tire Calligraphy collections are neutral-gender, this was the main direction for the styling of the models, them of course being of both gender. The idea was to switch the "roles", more precisely, the styles of the same clothing pieces - the girl wearing them oversized, for a baggy look, which in the 90s was predominantly a male "uniform"; and the guy wearing them as an alternative, true to size.

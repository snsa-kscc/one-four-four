A first short film ever created for Tire Calligraphy for it's then, latest offering, TC21 New Life / 199144. 

The time was 2020.-2021. 

The collection was envisioned, started to be produced - then hold abruptly to stop entirely - as the whole world was at that point of time, due to the lockdown and the massive spread of the COVID-19 virus; with addition to the largest earthquakes in Croatia in decades. Croatia was put on hold. The whole world was on hold. All of our lives were on hold. But we also need to continue. All of us... 

The new TC21 offering was appropriately named New Life. The premium part of the offering, with its universal timeless pieces, named 199144, was presented in its second iteration. 

Thus, it needed to be presented, shown to light from the darkness - from 0 to 1 respectively, with a fitting mix of stimuli, audio + visual. For this special opportunity, alongside the special film, we have created an accompanying **[Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7HEGiMY1rBL1VC8y8Cz8Y5?si=31d7e0e51eda480a)**.  

We have been doing so ever since.

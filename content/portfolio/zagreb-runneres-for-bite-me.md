**Client: Bite Me Nutrition**

**About the client**

A Croatian brand of healthy raw (power) snacks. 

**Project**

Content creation for social media channels.  

**[BITE ME](https://biteme-nutrition.com)** + Zagreb Runners as influencers

**Event concept / Influencer marketing / Storytelling**

A simple What better way to do something for the Zagreb running community, than to give the runners a chance to try out the new and highly awaited Nike trail running shoe, Nike Air Zoom Pegasus Trail. 

Every runner know shoes are a tool which works with and for them in their every day activity, be it a training session or on a race day. Also, the various conditions on a flat road surface and a track course, or be it "out in the wild", on the trails. Not every store and every brand gives its customer a chance to try out a product "IRL" before they buy it, so this is exactly what we were able to provide for the running community and customers of the Running Gate store. 

Joining forces with Nike Berlin, providing the test shoes and Zagreb Runners as Running Gates and Nike influencers in Croatia, hype via digital channels was created before the event itself. 

Every runner was able to try out the Peg Trail shoe in its natural environment - the location I found perfect was of course Maksimir - a favorite destination for all types of nature lovers, age groups and interests, be it them enjoying a casual walk, a picnic with a few badminton racquests on the side, a yoga session or a full, all out running session on the trails.  

To make it more fun, and of course a proper work out, after a warm up, the group did hill sprints with a competiton in the end and Running Gate of course provided the prizes and a much needed refreshment afterwards.

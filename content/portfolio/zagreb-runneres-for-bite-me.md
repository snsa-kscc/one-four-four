**Client: Bite Me Nutrition**

**About the client**

A Croatian brand of healthy raw (power) snacks. 

**Project**

Content creation for social media channels.  

**[BITE ME](https://biteme-nutrition.com)** + Zagreb Runners as influencers

**Event concept / Influencer marketing / Storytelling**

A simple way of signifying the importance of proper, healthy snack options, not just everyday, but even more so in "special/demanding" occasions - in this way presented as a fuel for hiking + trail running. 

This time, the "trail section" of Zagreb Runners was invited to take part and they delivered! They decided on the nice location, and content - an adventurous, picturesque hike. This was taken on one epic weekend hike in the neighbouring Slovenia.   

**Project management / Event planning / Execution**

**STATUS: Delivered**

A supporting piece of visual offering for Tire Calligraphy TC21 New Life / 199144. 

Exclusively created for Zagreb Design Week 2021.

As a second nomination, alongside with Best Design Award, the Fashion show part of ZGDW programme was decided to be the first TC runaway appereance ever. This occassion needed special content to be created. 

Each piece of the TC21 offering was presented with a 3D model mimicking the real life models walking the runaway. An audio soundscape, custom created for the first New Life video was used this time as well, in order to connect the two videos from the New Life campaign.

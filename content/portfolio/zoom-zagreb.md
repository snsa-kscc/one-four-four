**About the client** 

Running specialty store located in Zagreb, Croatia.

**About the project**

Trial event as a promo and to boost sales of the Nike Zoom Fly Flyknit running shoe.  

**[Running Gate](https://runninggate.hr)** + Zagreb Runners as influencers

**Event concept / Storytelling / Influencer marketing**

The first of the RG x Nike x Zagreb Runners trial event series was focused on the Nike Zoom Fly Flyknit running shoe. A gift in a way, from Running Gate and Nike ti every runner in Zagreb - to be able to try this amazing race shoe before they get the chance to buy it, of course, in its natural environment - this being the road and track. 

With support from Zagreb Runners, as Nike freaks, a first and so far still the only running crew in Croatia, not a sport or athletic club, but a real community of "real, everyday, normal" people who just like to run. Be it on the busy streets of Zagreb, the track, local park Maksimir or the nearby Medvednica moutnain.

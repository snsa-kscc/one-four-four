**Client: Ferivi / Running Gate**

**About the client** 

Running specialty store located in Zagreb, Croatia.

**About the project**

Trial event as a promo and to boost sales of the Nike Zoom Fly Flyknit running shoe.  

**[Running Gate](https://runninggate.hr)** + Zagreb Runners as influencers

**Event concept / Storytelling / Influencer marketing**

The first of the RG x Nike x Zagreb Runners trial event series was focused on the Nike Zoom Fly Flyknit running shoe. A gift in a way, from Running Gate and Nike to every runner in Zagreb - to be able to try this amazing race shoe before they get the chance to buy it, of course, in its natural environment - this being the road and track. 

With support from Zagreb Runners, as Nike freaks, a first and so far still the only running crew in Croatia, not a sport or athletic club, but a real community of "real, everyday, normal" people who just like to run. Be it on the busy streets of Zagreb, the track, local park Maksimir or the nearby Medvednica moutnain.  The "Just do it". 

After a digital campaign to create the hype and inform the people about the event, Zagreb Runners and every other interested runner joined the event which was envisioned as an easy warm up run on the streets of Zagreb, following with a track session - a proper training session with Zagreb Runners, this being the 400s. A little comp was executed on the spot, because, why not, right? Let's have some fun! ..after the cool down part of the session, we met again in the "hq", Running Gate store for refreshments and to announce the winners.

For Tire Calligraphy TC22 Crypto kids offering, again we referenced the 90s US pop culture from the logical sources such as film and music. As an inspiration for the photo shoot, I singled out a movie which influenced me in more ways, still in my high school years, way back in the 90s. This is what I wanted to "throw - back" at the teens of todays 21st century. This time the influence was the now iconic movie Hackers. As at that period oif time it was talked about "crypto everything" + NFTs, I found it super appropriate to introduce the new crowd to a bit of pop culture from the "early years". 

Of course, this time again, **[a special Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/45x6aikpn8hg9ziczww1q5gku?si=b1c846b98b824752&nd=1)** (with the music from the 90s - my own favourites), was introduced.         

**Concept / Project cooridnation / Location scouting / Model scouting / Model styling** 

As all Tire Calligraphy collections are neutral-gender, this was the main direction for the styling of the models, them of course being of both gender. The idea was to switch the "roles", more precisely, the styles of the same clothing pieces - the girl wearing them oversized, for a baggy look, which in the 90s was predominantly a male "uniform"; and the guy wearing them as an alternative, true to size.

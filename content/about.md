# 14.4

We all know first impression counts. 

Then again, we need to remind ourselves, there is more than meets the eye. 

What you will see might not be exactly what you need. Or maybe you just don’t know it yet.  

 

 

Why are we here and what we do?

With 15+ years of following and researching B2C, B2B and Brick & mortar, before D2C as a term even existed, when social media just started to be something; with 12+ years of experience, be it agency corporation, or NGO; we believe in circularity, sustainability, equal rights and diversity. In all industries and aspects of doing business. We love CSR and pro bono. 

Not at all just as catch phrases, but as solid foundation in approach to communication about products and services, while connecting them with the community, which needs to be just the right one.

We believe in the power of communities; communities of loyal die-hard fans, who in the end are or will become customers. 

Because we all sometimes need to remind ourselves, it is not about the product, but about the community which supports it. 

 

14.4 is about

Creating experiences.\
Curating stories.\
Connecting brands with communities.

 

 

Why are you here?

Maybe you are just curious. And that’s great. 

Maybe the last relationship didn’t work out. You need a change. The time is just right for you to try something different. 

 

Consider it like dating; you know what you don’t want, you have an idea what you wish for. But you need to be open, to give yourself a chance, and with this, to the other side as well. 

 

So, we invite you to send us an email, slide in our DMs, get in touch. No strings attached.
